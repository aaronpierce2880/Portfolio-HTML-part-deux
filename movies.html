 <h1>The Greatest Movies of ALL-TIME...According to Aaron</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies you MUST see before you go to Heaven</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls</h3>
 <p>This is one of the greatest comedies of all-time. This movie stars Jim Carrey who puts on an amazing comedic performance. It is one hilarious scene after another. Warning: this movie is for the inner 15 year-old boy in all of us. Roger Ebert probably did not like this film when it came out but over time audiences learned to appreciate Jim Carrey's comedic genius.</p>
 <br />
 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>This is a mind blowing sci-fi movie. Ground breaking action scenes that were never seen before in cinema. The story was great to and pulls you in. By the middle of the movie you wonder if you're in a computer program too!</p>
 <br />
 <h3>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</h3>
 <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger at his very best. This was another action movie that changed the game through its special effects. It has a great story as well. You don't have to watch the first movie to know what's going on. Even Roger Ebert had to give it three and a half stars.</p>
